#1. Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of them belongs to a different data type.
    a,b,c = 1, 2.01, "Paresh"
    print(a ," is ",type(a))
    print(b ," is ",type(b))
    print(c ," is ",type(c))

#2. Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.
    a = 1
    d = 1+2j
    print ("the values of 'a' and 'd' are ", a, " and", d), type(a), type(d)
    a, d = d, a
    print ("after swapping the values of 'a' and 'd' new values are ", a, " and", d), type(a), type(d)


#3. Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.

  Swap two numbers using a third
    e = 5
    f = 10
    print(“your first nubmer e is”, e)
    print(“your second nubmer f is”, f)
    temp_e = e
    e = f
    f = temp_e
    print ("now your new first nubmer e is ", e)
    print ("now your new second nubmer f is ", f)

  Swap two numbers without using any third variable.
    g =10
    h = 20
    print(“your first nubmer g is “, g)
    print(“your second nubmer h is”, h)
    g, h = h,g
    print ("now your new first nubmer g is ", g)
    print ("now your new second nubmer h is ", h)

#4. Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.

  For Python 2.x
    m= eval(raw_input("enter your input:")
    print(m)

  For Python 3.x
    n= eval(input("enter your input: "))
    print(n)

#5. Write a program to complete the task given below:
Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in another variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the
final output.

    x =eval(input("Enter first numbers in between 1-10:" ))
    y =eval(input("Enter second numbers in between 1-10:" ))
    z = x+y
    w = 30+z
    print("The final output is ", w)

#6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc

    q6 = eval(input("Enter something :"))
    print ("The data type of the input value is : ", type(q6))


#7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and UPPERCASE. (Refer: https://capitalizemytitle.com/camel-case/)
    TotalSum = 10
    totalSum = 20
    total_sum = 30
    TOTALSUM= 40

#8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

    In python, any data type can be assign variables by equal(=) sign. The data type declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable and we can change variable with any data type by specific way such as Strings in the quotation marks(" "), list in square brackets([ ]), tuples are enclosed within parentheses, and so on.
