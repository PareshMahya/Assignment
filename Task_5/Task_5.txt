# ________Task-5_________
# FILE HANDLING AND EXCEPTION HANDLING
#1.	Write a program in Python to allow the error of syntax to be handled using  exception handling.
HINT: Use SyntaxError 
try:
    ans = eval("Enter something :")
except SyntaxError:
    print("SyntaxError")
    
#2.	Write a program in Python to allow the user to open a file by using the argv module. If the entered name is incorrect throw an exception and ask them to enter the name again. Make sure to use read only mode. 

import sys
try:
    if sys.argv[1]=="test.txt":
        with open("test.txt")as f:
            f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Entered file name is invalid, Please, enter the name again :")

#3.	Write a program to handle an error if the user entered a number more than four digits it should return “The length is too short/long !!! Please provide only four digits”  

try:
    usr_ip = int(input("Enter four digits number :"))
    ip = str(usr_ip)
    if len(ip)!=4:
        raise ValueError ("Worng Number of Digit")
except ValueError:
     print("The length is too short/long !!!")

#4.	Create a login page backend to ask users to enter the username and password. Make sure to ask for a Re-Type Password and if the password is incorrect give chance to enter it again but it should not be more than 3 times. 

print('Enter correct username and password combo to continue')
count=0
username = input('Enter username : ')
if username =='Paresh':
    while count<3:
        password = input('Enter password: ')
        if password=='Pm13': 
            print('Access granted')
            break
        elif password !='Pm13' and count<3:
            print('Access denied. Re-Type Password.')
            count += 1
            print(count)
        elif count==3:
            break
        else:
            print("Oops, Password is incorrect.\nAccess denied.")
            break
elif username !='Paresh':
    print("Sorry, the Username is incorrect. \nAccess denied.")

#5.	Go through the link provided below to understand finally and raise concept: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/exception-handling  

try:
    usr_ip = int(input("Enter four digits number :"))
    ip = str(usr_ip)
    if len(ip)!=4:
        raise ValueError ("Worng Number of Digit")
    else: 
        print("Number of digit are good")
except ValueError:
     print("The length is too short/long !!!")
finally:
    print("Now, you are at the end program!")

#6.	Read doc.txt file using Python File handling concept and return only the even length string from the file. Consider the content of doc.txt as given below: 
Hello I am a file 
Where you need to return the data string 
Which is of even length 
Make sure you return the content in The same link as it is present.

file = open("/Users/pareshmahyavanshi/Desktop/git/Assignment/Task_5/doc.txt","r")
f = file.readline()
for f in file:
    if len(f)%2==0:
        print(f)
    else:
        pass
